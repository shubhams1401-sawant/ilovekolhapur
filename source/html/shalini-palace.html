        <p class="details">
          Located in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, Shalini Palace has earned its status for its grandeur and finery.
          Shalini Palace is the only palace hotel present in all over Maharashtra and has been reputed to give world-class services to its boarders.
          In front of the Palace, there is a picturesque lake called Lake Rankala which is so huge that it has a circumference of approximately 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles.
          The Lake is encircled by soaring palm trees, plush foliage and divine parks.
          The Bastion has been built of complexly whittled black stone and Italian marble.
          The doorways are opulent and ornate ligneous doorways which are tailored with carved Belgian glass bearing the crest of the Maharaja of Kolhapur, which are an addition to the imperial sumptuousness.
          Grandiose black stone archways form the balcony and the portico.
          The tainted glass archways and the colossal tower clock have been restored to their former glory.
