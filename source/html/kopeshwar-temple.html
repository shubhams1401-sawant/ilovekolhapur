        Kopeshwar Temple is a well-known Hindu shrine located in the city of Kolhapur, Maharashtra.
        This temple is dedicated to the fierce form of Lord Mahadeva known as Veerbhadra.
        Lord Shiva is worshiped here in the form of a Shivalinga as well as a sculpture of his fierce form, Veerbhadra.
        The interiors of the temple are adorned with the serpentine carvings on the walls.
        According to a legend, Daksha insulted Lord Shiva by not inviting him on a yagna.
        When he reached the place along with his wife Sati, Daksha was annoyed and used foul words for the Supreme Lord.
        Hearing this, Sati immolated herself as she couldn’t bear the insult of her husband.
        Her immolation has been displayed through the carvings on interiors walls of the temple.
