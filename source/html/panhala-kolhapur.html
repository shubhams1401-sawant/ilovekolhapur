        <p class="details">
          The history of Panhala is also the history of Marathas.
          Situated at a magnificent height of 3177 feet above sea level, Panhala commands a panoramic and awesome view of the valley.
          There are innumerable places of interest , each with its share of haunting anecdotes. Sajja Kothi, where Sambhaji was imprisoned. Ambabai Temple, where Shivaji used to seek blessings before venturing on expeditions. Pavankhind, where Baji Prabhu laid down his life to cover Shivaji's escape.<br><br>
          Panhala is redolent with memories of Shivaji.
          Not surprising, though, considering that barring his capitals at Rajgad and later Raigad, and Shivneri, where he spent his childhood, Panhala is the only fort where Shivaji spent more than 500 days.
          It was Maratha State capital until 1782 and in 1827 it went to the British.Besides, there's the Sambhaji temple Someshwar temple, Teen Darwaza, Raj Dindi.<br><br>
          This imposing fort, 20km northwest of Kolhapur, is built on an outlying spur of the Sahyadris, rising more than 400m above plain.
          The strategic importance of Panhala, guarding one of the principal routes through the Western Ghat, can be judged from its long and varied history.
          After serving as the headquarter of the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II (1178-1209), the site subsequently passed into hands of Yadavas.
          It was favorite outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar ; Mahmud Gawan, the powerful Prime Minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469.<br><br>
          By the beginning of the 16c Panhala was absorbed into the kingdom of Bijapur.
          The Adil Shahis were responsible for strengthening and rebuilding the ramparts and Gateways.
          The fort was raided by Shivaji in 1659, but it was not until 1673 that he was able to occupy it permanently.<br><br>
          In 1701 Panhala surrendered to Auragzeb, and it was here that the Mughal Emperor recieved the English Ambassador, Sir WilliamNorris. Within a few months the fort was retaken by the the Maratha forces under Pant Amatya Ramachandra, who asserted his autonomy by founding an independent dynasty.
          In 1782 these rulers shifted their headquarters to Kolhapur.
          After a local rebellion in 1844, Panhala was taken by the British.
          More than 7km of Fortifications define the approximently triangular zone of Panhala fort.
          The walls are protected for long sections by steep escarpments, reinforced by a parapet with slit holes.
          The remaining sections have 5-9m high ramparts, strengthened by round bastions. Unfortunately, the East Gate called Char Darawaja, through which the road passes on arrival at fort, was demolished by the British.

          Panhala Fort, one of the recognised forts of Maharashtra is also known as Panhalgad, Panhalla or Panalla. The word literally means “the house of the serpents”. This fort is based in Panhala which is 20 km northwest in Maharashtra, India. The fort speaks of the ancient Indian heritage and also of the grand reign of Shivaji Maharaj here. The fort is strategically placed where it can help to keep a vigilance over the pass in Sahyadri mountain ranges. This pass happens to be one of the main trade routes from Bijapur to the coastal areas. Due to this strategic position of the fort, it has been witnessing many wars and struggles between the Mughals, the Marathas and also the East India Company over the decades. This is the famous fort where the illustrated Tarabai have spent her formative years. Large part of the interiors of the fort has been kept intact the way they were since the beginning of their times. The fort is a great tourist attraction and is one of the elemental places to visit if you are on a Maharashtra tour.

          Copper plates reveal the fact that Panhala was under Bhoja II between the period of 1191 -1192 CE.
          The era 1209 -10 saw the defeat of Raja Bhoja by Singhana who was the most powerful monarch of Devagiri Yavadas.
          Soon the fort passed on to the Yavadas.<br>There after the fort passed on to various rulers.
          Finally in the year 1659 upon the death of Afzal Khan, the general of Bijapur, Shivaji Maharaj took over Panhala.
          In the year 1660 Adil Shah II sent his troops to Panhala to capture the fort and take it away from Shivaji Maharaj.
          A fierce battle followed.
          Finally all the resources of Shivaji was exhausted and he was on the verge of being captured by the enemy forces.
          Hence Shivaji had to flee. However in the year 1673 Shivaji Maharaj occupied the fort permanently.
